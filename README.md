This is the mobile apps for the software developement project class in my study, this mobile apps is using 100% java native. so this mobile apps has three parts, the customer
activity, the manager activity, and the driver activity. In the customer activity, user can do things like seeing all transaction, seeing promo and car brochure, giving a review point to the company
or the driver, etc. for the manager activity, the manager can print all the document that can be seen in below, the last activity is driver activity which driver can use
this apps for seeing their transaction, profile, etc.(this readme is still on developement)
